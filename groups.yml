  user:
    help: "The user counter reports the number of “user asserts” that have occurred since the last time the server process started. These are errors that user may generate, such as out of disk space or duplicate key. You can prevent these assertions by fixing a problem with your application or deployment. Check the MongoDB log for more information."

  rollovers:
    help: "The rollovers counter displays the number of times that the rollover counters have rolled over since the last time the server process started. The counters will rollover to zero after 230 assertions. Use this value to provide context to the other values in the asserts data structure."

    type: counter
  average_ms:
    help: "The average_ms value describes the relationship between the number of flushes and the total amount of time that the database has spent writing data to disk. The larger flushes is, the more likely this value is likely to represent a \"normal,\" time; however, abnormal data can skew this value"

  last_ms:
    help: "The value of the last_ms field is the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the last flush operation took to complete. Use this value to verify that the current performance of the server and is in line with the historical data provided by average_ms and total_ms"
    type: gauge
  last_finished:
    help: "The last_finished field provides a timestamp of the last completed flush operation in the ISODateformat. If this value is more than a few minutes old relative to your server’s current time and accounting for differences in time zone, restarting the database may result in some data loss"

    help: "The value of current corresponds to the number of connections to the database server from clients. This number includes the current shell session. Consider the value of available to add more context to this datum"

  available:
    help: "available provides a count of the number of unused available incoming connections the database can provide.
